package messages

/*
reqfleet is having a coordinatoir and engine design.
coordinator and engines are communicated via pubsub through TCP.
More specifically, the coordinator sends commands to the engines via broadcast. The commands are

- start
- stop

In the future, the coordinator could send other types of commands. So we need to have a future-proof design.

So it's better to define specific message types based on the communication needs.

- engines -> EngineMessage. This is the message broadcasted by the coordinator to the engines.
   * engines need to send the EngineMessage for engine topic
